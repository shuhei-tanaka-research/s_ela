Description: 
    Provides feature calculation methods for multi-objective continuous optimization problems.
    It implements decomposition-based and Non-dominated Sorting (NDS)-based approaches to calculate 
    Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) features in the multi-objective domain.
    The package includes various scalarization functions like Weighted Sum and Tchebycheff function.
    The main functions are `DecoELA` (decomposition-based) and `DomiELA` (NDS-based).
