Title: Scalarization-based Exploratory Landscape Analysis in Multi-Objective Continuous Optimization Problems
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Shuhei Tanaka
Maintainer: Shuhei Tanaka <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: 
    This package provides feature calculation methods for multi-objective continuous optimization problems.
    It implements two main approaches: decomposition-based and Non-dominated Sorting (NDS)-based
    approaches, which are used to calculate ELA features in multi-objective domain. 
    The package includes various scalarization functions like Weighted Sum and Tchebycheff function.
    The primary functions are `DecoELA` for decomposition-based feature calculation and
    `DomiELA` for NDS-based feature calculation.
