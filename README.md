# Scalarization-based Exploratory Landscape Analysis for Multi-Objective Continuous Optimization Problems
This repository contains code and experiments for Automated Algorithm Selection (AAS) and predicting algorithm performance using our proposed Scalarization-based Exploratory Landscape Analysis (S-ELA).

# Outline of our Experiment
- **Evaluation Problems**: Conbined 550 bbob-biobj problem instances with 2 dicision variables
- **Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm**: NSGA-II, SMS-EMOA, MOLE
- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest of Python library scilit-learn
